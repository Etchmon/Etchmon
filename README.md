### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm James

I am a self-taught developer/personal trainer. I mostly develop with JavaScript, but recently have been playing with Go, and am interested in Rust. I spend my free time messing with my homelab, playing with my dogs, and watching movies with my girlfriend.

Currently seeking a job at a startup where I can apply all my skills, and be encouraged to learn more.
