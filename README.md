### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm James

I am a self-taught developer and personal trainer with a passion for Linux and PC hardware. I am proficient in frontend, backend, and full-stack development. Currently, I am learning and practicing web3 dapp development and Docker, while also building a 40k PWA that I plan to release.

I am seeking a role at a startup or mid-sized company where I can leverage my problem-solving skills and contribute to a successful team from which I can learn and grow.
